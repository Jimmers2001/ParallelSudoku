Define "completion points" as points in the program where either a row, column, or block is completed.
Parallel IO will print the time of completion of one of these "completion points" as well as the board state at that time


for parallel io since I think each process needs to be designated a particular spot in the file,  
the output could look something like: 
PROCESS 1
proces 1 finished row 3 at time ... 
board:
[0,0,0 blahblahblah]


PROCESS 2


PROCESS 3
