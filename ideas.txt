TODO:
gather the 10 resources of research papers that have aspects we can incorporate
determine the best way to make sudoku parallel  
    * running several parallel algorithms at the same time
    * Go through all the resources, summarize them with bulletpoint notes, see what we can use in our own project

Define "completion points" as points in the program where either a row, column, or block is completed.
Parallel IO will print the time of completion of one of these "completion points" as well as the board state at that time

for parallel output since I think each process needs to be designated a particular spot in the file,  
    the output could look something like: 
    PROCESS 1
    proces 1 finished row 3 at time ... 
    board:
    [0,0,0 blahblahblah]

    PROCESS 2

    PROCESS 3

for parallel input:
    all mpi ranks work together to create the board     
        they all read from different spots, write into the main board, and then scatter it all back to the board
    allgather, scatter, broadcast
